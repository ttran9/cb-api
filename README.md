# Comp-Build-BackEnd

- Demo
  - A running demo for the front-end web application that utilizes this back-end API can be seen [here](https://www.compbuild.toddtran.com/)
  - This is currently hosted on a DigitalOcean Ubuntu instance which leverages Docker to run a separate Tomcat 9
  and MySQL server.
  - Stand alone [API here](https://www.cb-be.toddtran.com/api/computerbuild/)

- About
  - My main focus here will be to just refactor code. I will put emphasis on actively following design patterns and
  principles.
  - I will factor my unit and integration tests.
